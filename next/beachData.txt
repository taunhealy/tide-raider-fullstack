      "Expansive beach break with multiple peaks across 1.5km stretch. Three distinct areas: 'Big Rock' (southern end) offers longer right-handers up to 150m with occasional barrels on bigger swells, 'Middle Peak' provides consistent A-frame waves ideal for intermediate surfers, and 'Kite Beach' (northern end) reserved for kitesurfing. Wave mechanics vary significantly with tide - low tide exposes rock shelf creating hollow, punchy waves especially at Big Rock, while high tide offers fuller, more forgiving walls better for longboarding and beginners. Best performance on 4-6ft SW swell with 12-15 second period and SE-SSE winds under 15 knots. Morning sessions (before 11am) typically glassy with light offshore conditions before the Cape Doctor kicks in. Multiple rip channels between sandbars provide easy paddle-outs but create strong lateral currents - use landmarks to maintain position. Peak hierarchy strictly observed at Big Rock, while beach breaks offer more relaxed vibe. Winter (May-August) brings bigger swells and cleaner conditions with NW winds, while summer offers reliable 2-4ft waves perfect for learning. Shark spotters present during daylight hours. Facilities include showers, toilets, restaurants, and surf shops. Parking can be challenging on weekends - arrive early. Watch for bluebottles in summer months and seal activity near rocks. Wave quality highly dependent on sand movement - banks shift significantly after big storms.",

      "Legendary big wave spot breaking over three distinct reef sections. Outside peak ('The Ridge') starts working at 15ft and holds up to 60ft faces, producing steep drops into massive walls. Middle section ('The Bowl') creates perfect giant barrels, while inside section ('The Finger') offers slightly smaller but still challenging waves. Needs minimum 15ft SW-WSW groundswell with 15+ second period to break properly. SE winds under 15 knots provide best conditions. Deep-water channel allows boat access but extremely challenging paddle-out (30+ minutes) even for elite surfers. Multiple boils and ledges create unpredictable wave behavior - extensive local knowledge essential. Strong currents can sweep surfers kilometers out to sea. Only attempt with proper big wave equipment, safety team, and serious experience. Best during winter months (June-August) when large groundswells are most consistent.",

Morning sessions typically offer cleanest conditions before thermal winds increase. Multiple rip channels between sandbars aid paddle-outs but create strong currents - maintain position using land markers. Winter brings bigger swells and better winds, while summer offers reliable smaller waves. Popular local spot - respect peak hierarchy especially on good days. Limited parking near beach access.

      "Right-hand point break in Kalk Bay offering rides up to 200m in ideal conditions. Three distinct sections: outside peak ('The Point') provides steep drops and occasional barrels, middle section offers long walls perfect for carving, inside section ('The Reef') reforms for finish. Best performance on SW-W swells with light NW winds. Needs minimum 3ft to start working properly, handles up to 12ft. Wave quality highly tide-dependent - low tide exposes hazardous reef sections while high tide can swamp the break. Key takeoff zone is small and competitive - local hierarchy strictly enforced. Watch for strong backwash bouncing off harbor wall during bigger swells. Deep channel along harbor wall provides paddle-out option but creates dangerous current on bigger days. Early morning sessions recommended before onshore flow develops. Winter brings consistent groundswells and ideal wind conditions. Summer sessions possible but typically smaller and more inconsistent. Parking available at harbor but watch for break-ins. Local knowledge essential for navigating rocks and currents.",

Deep water channel on south side aids boat access, but paddle-outs extremely challenging (45+ minutes) and recommended only for elite surfers. Wave faces pitch steeply over reef creating critical takeoff zone - precise positioning essential. Multiple boils indicate shallow sections. Strong currents can push surfers far outside lineup - boat support strongly recommended. Best during winter months (June-August) when large groundswells coincide with favorable winds.

      "Consistent beach break located along Durban's Golden Mile. Multiple peaks offering both lefts and rights. Protected by shark nets and regular lifeguard patrols. Best performance on southerly swells with offshore NE winds. Wave quality ranges from punchy closeouts to longer workable walls depending on sandbank configuration. Works year-round but winter brings cleaner conditions. Popular spot that can get crowded during peak times. Good facilities including parking, showers, and restaurants nearby. Reunion Beach is located south of Durban, near Isipingo in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is further down the coast and is known for its less crowded and tranquil environment. It's a favorite among locals for fishing and relaxing away from the hustle of Durban's central beaches.",

      "North Beach in Durban is an exposed beach and pier break known for its reliable surf conditions. The ideal wind direction is from the west, with swells coming equally from windswells and groundswells. The optimal swell direction is from the southeast. The beach features right-hand breaks, and when the waves are good, the area can become crowded with surfers. Be cautious of potential hazards such as sharks, rocks, and jellyfish. Additionally, North Beach is a popular spot for both locals and tourists, offering a vibrant atmosphere with nearby amenities such as restaurants, shops, and lifeguard services. It's a great destination for surfers of varying skill levels, though beginners should be mindful of the crowd and potential hazards. The beach is also well-maintained, making it a pleasant place to relax when you're not in the water. Always check local surf reports and conditions before heading out, and respect the lineup etiquette to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone.",

One of Australia's most iconic point breaks, producing world-class right-hand barrels when conditions align. Located within Burleigh Head National Park, the break wraps around the headland creating perfect peeling waves. The area is famous for hosting the Burleigh Pro surfing competition and offers spectacular viewing from the headland where spectators gather to watch surfers tackle 'The Point'. Beyond surfing, visitors can explore the Burleigh Head National Park's rainforest walking tracks with panoramic coastal views and opportunities to spot wildlife including sea eagles, brush turkeys, and even migrating whales between June and November. Despite its quality, gets extremely crowded, especially during good conditions. Exercise caution around rips, rocks, sharks, and respect local surfers.",
