    description:
      "Exposed beach and reef break rated 3/5 with fairly consistent surf, though summer tends to be flat. Works best with East swell and Westerly offshore winds. Receives both windswells and groundswells equally. Features a left-hand reef break that's better than the right. Best conditions during rising high tide. Despite good waves when working, crowds are unknown. Watch out for sea urchins and sharks.",
